# rclayui - a raylib + clay component library (WIP)

The clay library is awesome but is missing form components.
This is a collection of components that I've written to fill in the gaps.

Massive work in progress.

## Components (and TODO)

- [x] Button
    - [x] hover state
    - [x] Press state and result
    - [x] Disabled state

- [ ] TextField
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] RadioButton
