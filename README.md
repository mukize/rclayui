# rclayui - a raylib + clay component library (WIP)

The clay library is awesome but is missing some CRUDish components.
This is a collection of components that I've written to fill in the gaps.

Massive work in progress.

## Components (and TODO)

- [x] Button
    - [x] hover & press style
    - [x] Disabled state
    - [x] Returns true if pressed

- [ ] TextField
    - [x] Style (ish)
    - [x] Capturing input
    - [x] Working-ish backspace
    - [ ] Functional cursor
    - [ ] Repeat text
    - [ ] Repeat backspace
    - [ ] Move edit cursor
    - [ ] Change text at edit cursor
    - [ ] Hide overflow text
    - [ ] Secret text
    - [ ] copy paste

- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] RadioButton
